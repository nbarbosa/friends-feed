# friends-feed

A project with AngularJS + Node.js + MongoDB + Karma that mimics a friendship-based news feed (i.e. friends can see their friends' posts and their own).

## Install dependencies

### Client side

Run `npm install` followed by `bower install`.

### Server side

Run `npm install`.

## Build & development

### Client side

Make sure to properly set the constants that will point to the server side app in `app.js`:

* AppConfig.api_url
* AppConfig.image_server_url

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

### Server side

Make sure to properly set the MongoDB connection URI `MONGO_URI` as an environment variable. The dotenv plug-in allowes settings this through the `.env` file.

Make sure to run the seed script `seed.js` by running `node seed.js`. This will create 3 users with the following relationships:

* John is friends with Jessica and Peter
* Jessica is friends with John
* Peter is friends with John
* Note that Jessica is not friends with Peter

Run `npm start`

If environment variable `PORT` is not set, it will run at port 3000.

## Distribute (client side only)

### Client side

Run `grunt build` and grab a distribution-ready version from the `dist` folder.

## Testing (client side only)

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
