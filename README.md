# friends-feed

A project with AngularJS + Node.js + MongoDB + Karma that mimics a friendship-based news feed (i.e. friends can see their friends' posts and their own). Here's how it works:

1. Pick one of the users to enter
1. See updates (posts) from friends
1. Post a new update
1. Refresh the page to be able to enter as another user

## Install dependencies

### Client side

Run `npm install` followed by `bower install`.

### Server side

Run `npm install`.

## Build & development

### Client side

Make sure to properly set the constants that will point to the server side app in `app.js`:

* AppConfig.api_url - By default, it will be pointing to a deployed app online.
* AppConfig.image_server_url - By default, it will be pointing to a deployed app online.

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

### Server side

For your convenience, there is a deployed app online in case you don't want to set up the server application on your machine. The client app points to it by default.

Make sure to properly set the MongoDB connection URI `MONGO_URI` as an environment variable. The dotenv plug-in allows setting this through the `.env` file.

Make sure to run the seed script `seed.js` by running `node seed.js`. This will create 3 users with the following relationships:

* John is friends with Jessica and Peter
* Jessica is friends with John
* Peter is friends with John
* Note that Jessica is not friends with Peter

The seed script will create no posts.

Run `npm start`

If environment variable `PORT` is not set, it will run at port 3000.

#### Endpoints
Assume `1` for the user ID in the examples below:

##### Add a new post
    POST /posts
    Content-Type: application/json

    { userId: 1, content: 'This is a new post' }

##### Get posts (from friends and self)
    GET /posts?userId=1

##### Get all users
    GET /users

##### Get a user's profile (including friends)
    GET /users?userId=1

## Distribute (client side only)

### Client side

Run `grunt build` and grab a distribution-ready version from the `dist` folder.

## Testing (client side only)

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
